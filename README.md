# Data-Visualization--Pie-Chart
Pie Chart visualization with exploding in python
An "exploding pie chart" is a type of data visualization technique used to emphasize or highlight specific segments of a pie chart by separating them from the rest of the chart. In a standard pie chart, all the segments (or "slices") are displayed within the circle, but in an exploding pie chart, one or more segments are visually separated or "exploded" from the center of the pie to make them stand out.

The purpose of using an exploding pie chart is to draw attention to certain data points or categories, making them more easily distinguishable. This can be helpful when you want to highlight important information or trends in your data. The exploded segments often appear as if they are slightly pulled away from the center of the pie chart, creating a visual effect that makes those segments more prominent.

However, it's important to use exploding pie charts sparingly and with care. Overusing this technique can make a chart look cluttered and less readable. It's generally recommended to use other types of charts, like bar charts or stacked bar charts, when dealing with complex data sets, as they can be more effective in conveying information. Exploding pie charts are most useful when you want to emphasize a specific segment or a small number of segments within a simple data set.
